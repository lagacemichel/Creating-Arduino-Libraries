# Creating Arduino Libraries
Directory structure containing all atefacts required to create an Arduino
library. The main directory contains the library.properties file that
describes the library and its properties, the keywords.txt file that lists
the keywords that will be highlighted by the Arduino IDE, the README.md
file, this file, that describes the content of the Github repository and the
LICENSE.txt file that contains the license associated to the project.

The src subdirectory contains the DHT22 sensor library components: a header
file containing a class description for the sensor library and an
implementation file containing the sensor library code. the examples
subdirectory contains an Arduino sketch demonstrating the use of the
DHT22 sensor library. Finally, the extras subdirectory, contains a PDF file
containing a previous Mike's Electroshack post on the use of the DHT22 sensor
to provide relative humidity and temperature readings.
